Feel free to storyboard here and talk about abstract stuff before placing things in say the PokePlan document.

Plot:

-The original stories were when Red was about 10 years old. This story would take place somewhere around when red is 50 or 60 at the least. That is to say the characters you may meet could be the third generation of the heroes or the second generation. Or perhaps not. We could always do multiverse theory and shift you between Red's world and your own. You could also be 10-30 years in the future when Red and his friends are between the ages of 30 and 40. Adults and perhaps leaders or outcasts of their world.

WARNING: THERE'S A LOT OF CLICHE CAUSE I TURNED ON RPG MODE IN MY HEAD BUT THATS WHERE YOU COME IN TO FIX IT. I'M THINKING I NEED MORE R. L. STEIN AND LEMONY SNICKET IN MY DIET WITH SOME R. A. SALVATORE or even R. R. MARTIN LEVEL OF FUCKED UP CHARACTERS. Just remember the world is a cruel place children, but you always have options if you try. We need to fit like 8 regions worth of story telling in this bitch.

-the trainer Mach (short for MAin CHaracter i kno im cleber) spawns in Pallet town and has a deal in with his bastard (fatherless, counterpart to the notorious porn site name) childhood friend Andrew (andrew is the friend right?) decides its a dreat day to go out into the outskirts of town without adult supervision ................................................................. Then he loses his Eevee, it's up to you and the gang (just kidding u have no friends) to find Eevee because fking andrew only had one pokemon, plebian parents man..............................................You learn that Andrew's father is Team Aqua's Archie and ...............................You continue to run into but lose sight of the Eevee. for some reason people become very interested in your lost pokemon and why you're looking for that interesting pokemon. What are you planning to do with it. Why do you want it so bad...............................You travel and do what you can to avoid or defeat obstacles on your search for the Eevee and as time passes you begin to hear disaster stories about your prefecture........................... you get out eventually that Andrew is a fking waterbender of sorts who went berserk and left town unexpectedly one night and it rained like never before in history. Word is delivered to you by a man u met in a neighboring town that he grew weary and spoke of going to look for what he lost on his own. You never knew Andrew had powers though he swimmed to be a naturally better swimmer and take to water well. You wonder why andrew stayed so hydrated in his youth, good health practices that's all. You didn't know It's not very unusual in our world for people to rise up on occasion with unexplainable powers, there are psychics there those who can whisper with the dead, those who can talk to the spirits, those who can speak with and heal other pokemon, and all kinds of other mystiques. These were always fables to you. But most of the time people are understanding when they come across such things in real life and those powers come to the good of both our world and the spiritual world but in Andrew's case......................Somewhere in here the hell must be explained or before................................You need to go off to search for a way to fix this new problem but the strange incidences that seem to correlate with Andrew are happpening opposite of the direction you're heading to search for the Eevee (The player must here choose to go after his friend and try to take care of him or find his eevee so that he may bring it to him in an effort to calm him down. I don't think we should allow one to simultaneously strive to do both but we can talk)............................................ (you decide to chase the Eevee) The eevee is found and taken by a thief looking for something in a lab not very different from the old headquarters team rocket built in silph co. but you dont know that thats a pokespe referencce. You see signs that this lab was used for demented things, torture, abuse, experiments and something to do with the alterations of genetic code and forced evolution or move learning. You find more hints to where Eevee could be...............I could probably fit my gijinka story in here if the user happens to run into the secret town where boom motherfkr, experimentation or some occult fucked up shit and the people and pokemon have become gijinkas, maybe we can even follow it up in a manner where you become a gijinka or not depending on your choices...........................As you continue your investigation across the land............................................. people begin to close their doors to you and others turn you whether in fear of becoming collateral damage in the hell that has awakened or for their own personal gains and vendettas. You cannot return home. You are forced to let go of your identity. Words come up of the heroes of older days. And so you being yet another search for these heroes of old as your guide. Those who are willing to help are too weak, they ask you to seek the help of the spirits, the guardians of our world. And so you must look for them too............................There can be corrupt gym leaders and officials, dark spirits like Giratina or even Darkrai and corrupted guardians such as jirachi or celebii.............................and that's it for now.

All active organizations from game or MIA organizations will be in the final touches of the game such as Plasma whose leaders have gone missing. Some research on the game plots but more importantly, the complex pokemon adventures/pokemon special plot is necessary. The game will pay much tribute to the latter. Serebii is your new best friend.

-rez - i just remembered that mew was originally discovered in guyana so ill be damned if we dont get to guyana at some point and brazil. and by god we will have an amazon hunt for mew and be threatened with death by snu snu or my name isnt retarded.

Game Mechanics:

-One v One Battle and AI interaction beginning development...

Concepts to be fully developed and completed:

- Pokemon Amie

    Andrew: The amount of things you can do in it. If there was a way to customize and make your own background for the room(maybe even get the option send your furniture designs to the people you pass by), some way for you to interact with more than one pokemon at a time to make things interesting(also adding the possibility for those two or more to interact in the screen with each other)[to be more specific you can't do anything substantial with other people's pokemon], different things other than just rubbing(perhaps pulling on hair? Would be interesting). The mini-games are okay and do their job. Maybe my head is just in the clouds.

- Pokedex

    Mel & Rez: Autologs Name and type of pokemon you encounter, Diary/journal in pokedex to take notes of your choice, Can also take pictures saved as notes or photo album in pokedex, has wifi/gps but loses wifi/gps in caves, tunnels, small towns, forests, etc.

- Poketch

    Rezaul: could be hand in hand with pokedex or secondary gear. Will count time, count steps, count encounters, have apps like item finder radar, and include all options from previous poketches.

- Training skills (refer to PokePlan on Skills) and the physical limits of the trainer

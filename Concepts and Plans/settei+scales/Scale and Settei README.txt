First the Settei - settei are essentially drawing references. All our settei (majority of them pokemon and not people, do not expect environment, those drawing references go in mapping) will eventually be placed here to assist in 3D modelling and rigging and animation. Because of our severe lack of human settei, we expect you to post as many as you find here. Please make sure they're of good quality, hopefully official art. Use the files already here as examples of what you should post. Please label accordingly, follow the pikachu files for naming pokemon and humans. If you do not know their numbers, feel free to use the names, we'll have to for trainers anyway. The settei source url file can help you get started.

For now actual mathematical scales and proportions for everything are in the settei folder, put them in the "Scales for humans and environment" text file there. Please attempt to keep the integrity of the format in place. If you need be more detailed which you damn well need be, then add more detail. Things only have their y-dimensions recorded for now cuz I'm a lazy shit. You are expected to put down the general XYZ measurements as well as additional measurements needed to attempt to recreate whatever you made.

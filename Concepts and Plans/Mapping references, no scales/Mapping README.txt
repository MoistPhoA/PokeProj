This is a palce for mapping reference both Interior and Exterior. That means references for everything from the steep hills of the mountainside to your mother's kitchen. There are no mathematical scales unless theyre included in the drawings.
Scales for architecture maybe added here for later additions; that means buildings and rocket ships or something, not trees or mountains or lakes and shit.

For now actual mathematical scales and proportions for everything are in the settei folder, put them in the text file there. Please attempt to keep the integrity of the format in place. If you need be more detailed which you damn well need be, then add more detail. Things only have their y-dimensions recorded there for now cuz I'm a lazy shit.

These are going to be mainly drawing references to help you see what your world should look like so that you can mold it properly.

If you're mapping you are expected to create the geography of the land as well as plot out where architecture goes. you do not have to build infrastructures yourself unless you wish. You will then take the actual buildings when theyre done and plot them in their places on the map and adjust the scaling if necessay. A lot of the freedom to decide the size and details of the geography is in your hands so I hope you're good with outdoors shit. I know none of us ever leave our room so just use your imagination if you can if yu have no idea wth a hill should look like.
